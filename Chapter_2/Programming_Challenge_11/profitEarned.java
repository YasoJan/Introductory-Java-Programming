Programming Challenge 11

An electronics company sells circuit boards at a 40 percent profit. If you know the retail
price of a circuit board, you can calculate its profit with the following formula:
Profit = Retail price Ã— 0.4
Write a program that asks the user for the retail price of a circuit board, calculates the
amount of profit earned for that product, and displays the results on the screen.
